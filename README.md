## Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and run the Streamlit application on your local machine.

## Step 1: Obtain API Key & Credentials

You will need to obtain the following API key & Credentials:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `SALESFORCE_USERNAME`
- `SALESFORCE_PASSWORD`
- `SALESFORCE_SECURITY_TOKEN`


Once you have your keys, you will need to set them as environment variables. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

The application requires certain Python packages to run. These dependencies are listed in a `requirements.txt` file.
Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
